# Hikeroutes
A web site for publishing hiking routes (not yet functional)
It is written with  in php and the Laveral framework

This project also serves as a simple example project for a personal research into component based layout system that uses  XML files.

Because i'm rewriting the use  VC from PHP to XML, the structure is going to change completely (It's not good enough at this moments).

The VC part is now separated from this project and moved to the XMLView repository.
